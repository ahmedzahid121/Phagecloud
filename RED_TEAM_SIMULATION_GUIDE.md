## üìä Understanding Results

### Attack Results Grid

- **Timestamp**: When the attack step was executed
- **Attack Type**: Category of attack (e.g., "Credential Dump")
- **Step**: Specific action performed
- **Result**: Success/Failure of the attack
- **Blocked**: Whether security controls prevented the attack
- **Detected**: Whether security controls detected the attack

### Security Score

- **Overall Score**: Average protection across all categories
- **Individual Scores**: Protection level for each attack category
- **Color Coding**: 
  - üü¢ Green (90-100%): Excellent protection
  - üü° Orange (70-89%): Good protection
  - üü† Yellow (50-69%): Fair protection
  - üî¥ Red (0-49%): Poor protection

### Protection Logs

Shows detailed information about how your security modules responded:

- **‚úÖ PROTECTION**: Attack was successfully blocked
- **‚ö†Ô∏è DETECTION**: Attack was detected but not blocked
- **‚ùå GAP**: Attack was not detected or blocked

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Attack Playbooks

You can create custom attack scenarios by modifying the playbook creation methods in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`:

```csharp
private RedTeamAgent.AttackPlaybook CreateCustomPlaybook()
{
    return new RedTeamAgent.AttackPlaybook
    {
        Id = "custom_attack",
        Name = "Custom Attack Simulation",
        Description = "Your custom attack scenario",
        Steps = new List<RedTeamAgent.AttackStep>
        {
            new RedTeamAgent.AttackStep 
            { 
                Name = "Custom Step", 
                Action = "simulate_custom_action", 
                DelayMs = 2000 
            }
        },
        AutoCleanup = true,
        TimeoutSeconds = 60
    };
}
```

### Adding New Attack Types

To add new attack simulation types:

1. **Add** the simulation method to `RedTeamAgent.cs`
2. **Add** the case in `ExecuteAttackStepAsync`
