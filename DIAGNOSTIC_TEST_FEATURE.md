### File Outputs

The diagnostic test generates two files on the desktop:

1. **PhageVirus_Diagnostic_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt**
   - Human-readable detailed report
   - Formatted for easy reading
   - Contains all diagnostic sections

2. **PhageVirus_Diagnostic_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log**
   - Machine-readable log format
   - Compatible with log analysis tools
   - Same content as report file

### Performance Impact

- **Test Duration**: Typically 5-10 seconds
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal during test execution
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB additional memory
- **Disk I/O**: Light read operations for system information
- **Network**: Only if email sending is enabled

## Integration

### With Existing Modules

The Diagnostic Test integrates seamlessly with existing PhageVirus modules:

- **EnhancedLogger**: All diagnostic activities are logged
- **EmailReporter**: Email functionality for report delivery
- **BehaviorTest**: Complementary to behavior analysis
- **ProcessWatcher**: Monitors diagnostic process execution

### API Usage

```csharp
// Run diagnostic test without email
var success = await DiagnosticTest.RunDiagnosticTest(false, "");

// Run diagnostic test with email
var success = await DiagnosticTest.RunDiagnosticTest(true, "admin@company.com");
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Local Storage**: Reports saved locally on desktop
- **Email Security**: Uses configured SMTP with authentication

### Access Requirements
- **Standard User**: Most checks work with standard privileges
- **Admin Rights**: Some checks require elevated privileges
- **WMI Access**: Requires WMI permissions
- **Event Log Access**: Requires event log read permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WMI Access Denied**
   - Run as administrator
   - Check Windows Management Instrumentation service
   - Verify WMI permissions

2. **Event Log Access Failed**
   - Ensure event log service is running
   - Check user permissions
   - Verify registry access

3. **Email Sending Failed**
   - Check SMTP configuration
   - Verify email address format
   - Ensure network connectivity

4. **Performance Counters Unavailable**
   - Run as administrator
   - Check Performance Counter service
   - Verify counter permissions
