# üåê Cloud Telemetry Display Guide

## üìã Overview

The **Cloud Telemetry Display** feature allows you to see real-time cloud metrics and telemetry data directly in your PhageVirus desktop application. This includes:

- **Cloud CPU and Memory Usage** from AWS Lambda
- **Local vs Cloud Performance** comparison
- **Threat Detection Metrics** from cloud analysis
- **Lambda Function Status** and performance
- **S3 and DynamoDB Usage** statistics
- **Real-time Threat Alerts** from cloud processing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Updated Lambda Function

First, deploy the updated Lambda function with metrics support:

```powershell
# Navigate to Lambda directory
cd phagevirus-cloud-implementation/phagevirus-lambda

# Deploy with metrics support
.\deploy-with-metrics.ps1
```

### 2. Update Desktop Application

The desktop application now includes the `CloudTelemetryDisplay` module. When you start PhageVirus, it will automatically:

- Initialize cloud telemetry display
- Connect to your AWS Lambda function
- Start fetching metrics every 30 seconds
- Display cloud data in the log window

### 3. View Cloud Metrics

Once running, you'll see cloud metrics in the log window like this:

```
[CLOUD METRICS] Local CPU: 15.2% | Local RAM: 45.8% | Cloud CPU: 12.1% | Cloud RAM: 38.5% | Threats: 3 | Risk Score: 65.5% | Lambda Status: Active
[METRICS] Local CPU: 15.2%, Cloud CPU: 12.1%, Health: 34.5%
[CLOUD ALERT] Threats: 3, Risk: 65.5%
```

## üìä What You'll See

### Real-Time Metrics Display

The application shows comprehensive metrics including:

#### **Performance Metrics**
- **Local CPU Usage**: Your VM's current CPU usage
- **Local RAM Usage**: Your VM's current memory usage  
- **Cloud CPU Usage**: AWS Lambda function CPU usage
- **Cloud RAM Usage**: AWS Lambda function memory usage
- **System Health**: Overall security health percentage

#### **Threat Metrics**
- **Threats Detected**: Number of threats found by cloud analysis
- **Threats Blocked**: Number of threats successfully blocked
- **Risk Score**: Current system risk assessment (0-100%)
- **Severity Level**: Highest threat severity detected

#### **Cloud Service Metrics**
- **Lambda Status**: Function health and status
- **Lambda Invocations**: Number of function calls
- **Lambda Duration**: Average execution time
- **S3 Storage Used**: Amount of data stored in S3
- **DynamoDB Records**: Number of telemetry records processed

### Threat Timeline Integration

Cloud-detected threats automatically appear in the threat timeline:

```
[CLOUD THREAT] High: Suspicious Process - powershell.exe
[CLOUD THREAT] Critical: Memory Injection - explorer.exe
```

## üîß Configuration

### Lambda Function URL

The application connects to your Lambda function using this URL:
```
https://phagevirus-telemetry-processor.lambda-url.ap-southeast-2.on.aws/
```

And your API Gateway using this URL:
```
https://9tjtwblsg3.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/
```

### Configuration File

The configuration is stored in:
```
%LocalAppData%\PhageVirus\config\cloud-display-config.json
```

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "LambdaFunctionUrl": "https://phagevirus-telemetry-processor.lambda-url.ap-southeast-2.on.aws/",
  "ApiGatewayUrl": "https://9tjtwblsg3.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/",
  "EndpointId": "endpoint-YOUR-COMPUTER-NAME-YOUR-USERNAME-PROCESSID",
  "RefreshIntervalSeconds": 30,
  "EnableRealTimeUpdates": true,
  "ShowDetailedMetrics": true,
  "MaxHistoryItems": 100
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Cloud Telemetry Display

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```powershell
# Test the cloud telemetry display
.\test-cloud-telemetry.ps1
```

### Test Lambda Metrics Endpoint

Test the Lambda function's metrics endpoint directly:

```powershell
# Navigate to Lambda directory
cd phagevirus-cloud-implementation/phagevirus-lambda

# Test metrics endpoint
$testPayload = @{
    agentId = "test-endpoint-001"
    timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
    dataType = "Metrics"
    data = @{
        requestType = "get_metrics"
        includePerformance = $true
        includeThreats = $true
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

$testPayload | Out-File -FilePath "test-metrics.json" -Encoding UTF8

aws lambda invoke `
    --function-name phagevirus-telemetry-processor `
    --payload file://test-metrics.json `
    --region ap-southeast-2 `
    response-metrics.json

Get-Content response-metrics.json | ConvertFrom-Json
```

## üìà Understanding the Metrics

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Local (VM) | Cloud (AWS) | What it means |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **CPU Usage** | 15.2% | 12.1% | Your VM is using more CPU than the cloud processing |
| **Memory Usage** | 45.8% | 38.5% | Your VM is using more memory than the cloud processing |
| **System Health** | 34.5% | - | Overall security health (lower = more threats) |

### Threat Analysis

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Threats Detected** | 3 | Number of threats found by cloud analysis |
| **Threats Blocked** | 2 | Number of threats successfully neutralized |
| **Risk Score** | 65.5% | Current system risk (0-100%) |
| **Severity** | High | Highest threat severity level |

### Cloud Service Status

| Service | Status | Performance |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Lambda Function** | Active | 150ms average duration |
| **S3 Storage** | 2.5MB used | 15 objects stored |
| **DynamoDB** | 25 records | 3 threat records |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **"Failed to fetch cloud metrics"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Lambda function URL is correct
- Ensure Lambda function is deployed and running

#### **"Lambda function not found"**
- Deploy the Lambda function first using `deploy-with-metrics.ps1`
- Check AWS credentials are configured correctly
- Verify the function name matches your deployment

#### **"No metrics displayed"**
- Check the log window for initialization messages
- Verify the CloudTelemetryDisplay module is initialized
- Check configuration file exists and is valid

#### **"High latency in metrics"**
- The refresh interval is 30 seconds by default
- You can reduce it in the configuration file
- Check your internet connection speed

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging by setting `ShowDetailedMetrics` to `true` in the configuration:

```json
{
  "ShowDetailedMetrics": true
}
```

This will show additional debug information in the log window.
